# Week 1

**Date:** 16.02.2026 - 20.02.2026

**Role:** Dev in team **Tracing**

## Activities

* **General planification**
    * *Action:* Took part in the general project planification to define milestones per week. 
    * *Artefacts:* [Document file (permalink Github)](https://github.com/Toys-R-Us-Rex/Duckify/blob/1787a64b540681b7a8b219607760a1050d72c1cd/docs/planning/steps_milestones.typ)
    * *Justification:* It is necessary to have a plan of the general project evolution. This enable to anticipate difficult section to come, thus allowing to redistribute working force if needed. It also help to ensure that no unseen dependencies between teams are leftover.

* **Tracing team planification**
    * *Action:* Took part in the tracing team planification to lay out a pipeline overview. 
    * *Artefacts:* [Document file (permalink Github)](https://github.com/Toys-R-Us-Rex/Duckify/blob/058f40182c9abd4c097b731ee1d95ff6e53512c0/docs/architecture/tracing/general-overview.typ)
    * *Justification:* This overview is a 1rst step in the tracing pipeline construction. This lay out a complete road to follow.

* **Research**
    * *Action:* Research a solution for texture projection solution, as this step was defined in the [General overview of the tracing process (permalink Github)](https://github.com/Toys-R-Us-Rex/Duckify/blob/058f40182c9abd4c097b731ee1d95ff6e53512c0/docs/architecture/tracing/general-overview.typ.)
    * *Artefacts:* [Research report file (permalink Github)](https://github.com/Toys-R-Us-Rex/Duckify/blob/15c1dbc08bc9060aa37bc681666f70380cd02b3d/docs/research/projection_solution.typ)
    * *Justification:* Taking time before implementation to look out for a complete solution 
    * *Result:* Promising solution found, tested but not selected.

* * **Meeting report**
    * *Action:* Make a summary of a daily meeting
    * *Artefacts:* [Meeting report file (permalink Github)](https://github.com/Toys-R-Us-Rex/Duckify/blob/be49ae5f111835d253c54c89245da1a22305db2c/docs/meetings/2026-02-19.typ)
    * *Justification:* Need of documentation to have the overview of project evolution

## Blocker/Resolution

* **Problem:** The TEXTurePaper solution is a 2023 repo with multiple unprecised dependencies version. This made the enviromment setup error prone.
* **Solution:** First, always look in the repo issues if same problem have already been solved. If not, then find dependencies versions that work with the current system based of plausible time of implementation.

* **Problem:** The TEXTurePaper solution used models versions not hosted anymore and specificly configured for depth.
* **Solution:** Look for alternative internet hosted models version that still exist.


## Self-Reflection
> **What went well?**

I was able to find a promising solution for the texture projection problem.

> **What could be improved?**

The time spent in meeting was sometimes not efficient, I should have been more proactive to ensure the productivity and the shortness of the meetings.

> **What did you learn?**

I learned that working from an old repo (2023), in such a evolving topic, is error prone and time-consuming. 

## Possible Interview Questions

**Q1: How do you ensure that your documentation stays up to date with the code?**

**A:** By adding constant updates to the documentation as I work on the code. One code block task done should be immediately followed by an update in the documentation to reflect the changes and ensure that the documentation is always accurate and useful for future reference.

**Q2: Why could TEXTure be a suitable solution for this project?**

**A:** TEXTure is a suitable solution because it is specifically designed for texture projection in 3D environments and provides a robust framework for handling complex texture mapping scenarios.

**Q3: How would you approach a situation where a meeting is not led properly?**

**A:** I would take the initiative to lead the meeting. My approach would be to first reclarify the meeting's objectives and agenda, then facilitate the discussion to ensure that it stays on track and that all participants have the opportunity to contribute.
